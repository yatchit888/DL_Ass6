# Ex-6: Trainable Layers in Neural Networks

## Overview
In this exercise, you will learn to create and modify neural network layers.

## Objectives
1. Define dense models with multiple hidden layers.
2. Set specific layers as trainable or non-trainable.

## The Assignment

### define_dense_model_with_hidden_layers
Modify your solution from the previous exercise for `define_dense_model_with_hidden_layers`. This function should accept an array of hidden layer sizes and an array of the activation functions. Keep the following points in mind when coding:

* The first layer is different because it should accept an `input_layer` parameter.
* The output layer should use the `output_function` and `output_length` parameters.

### set_layers_to_trainable
The function `set_layers_to_trainable` should take a model and an array of layer numbers. It should set the layers in the array to `trainable` and the other layers to non-trainable.

## Validating and Evaluating Your Results

### Online
1. After committing and pushing your code, check the mark on the top line (near the commit ID).
2. If some tests are failing, click on the ‚ùå to open up a popup, which will show details about the errors.
3. You can click the [Details]() link to see what went wrong. Pay special attention to lines with the words "Failed" or "error".

4. Near the bottom of the [Details]() page, you can see your score. Here are examples of 0/5 and 5/5:

5. When you achieve a perfect score, you will see a green checkmark near the commit ID.

### Locally
1. You can test your code locally by installing and running `pytest` (`pip install pytest` or `conda install pytest`).
2. Run the tests using the command `pytest` in your terminal. This will show the status of each test and any errors that occurred.

Good luck!
